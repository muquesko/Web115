        <h2>A page about Kayla Bryd</h2>
        <d1>
            <dt>Basic info</dt>
            <dd>-First name: Kayla</dd>
            <dd>-Last name: Bryd</dd>
            <dd>-Gender: Female</dd>
        </d1>  
        <h2>Personality</h2>
            <p>
                Kayla’s mother <mark>Margaret</mark> was always anti-social so this trait rubbed off of her. A few of Kayla’s friends and her family helped her through this and now she can fake being outgoing and seeks making friends though she isn’t usually the one to start a conversation. Due to nervousness and not knowing what to say Kayla will blabber on about what she knows like herself and her interests. In a conversation, Kayla has a bad habit of interrupting, even when she’s perfectly aware it’s their turn to talk.

                Like her dad Kayla is affectionate with her friends and family and loves hugs. Kayla enjoys making jokes with her friends, usually these jokes involve poking fun of herself, this is to make her feel more comfortable when she’s around other people and to hide her own insecurities. She’s also not over critical about things and is lenient. Kayla also is modest and gets embarrassed when she receives compliments. However there has a few times that rather than being modest, she’s down on herself assuming the worst, though she desperately tries looking at the bright side of things.

                Kayla’s is a very enthusiastic person and will usually take interest in something new. Due to her friends, especially <mark>Lina</mark>, Kayla is very open minded and will generally consider diverse options of people. For example she’s aware that not everyone celebrates Christmas.

                Kayla is also stubborn and refuses to consider other people’s opinions or ideas. She also has a tendency to jumps to conclusions and gets offended easily, by those she doesn’t know. An example of this is she assumes people think of her as inferior because of her blindness. Kayla tries to be independent, often to prove people wrong about her disability. She has a really short temper and yells at people when she feels they are at fault, for example she is not a morning person and hates when her little brother <mark>Carl</mark> wakes her up. Even though <mark>Howard</mark> Kayla’s father eats decently and wants his family to be the same why, Kayla whenever she has the chance will eat too much candy and other unhealthy things.
