       <p>"A Way to Understand" is about teaching children about differences and just because someone is different doesn't make them any less capable then another person. "A Way to Understand" does this with the two main characters Jacob who is Deaf and Kayla who is blind. They have talents, they have interests, they enjoy life just as anyone else would and being different doesn't change that.</p>
