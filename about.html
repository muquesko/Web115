                    Brewno Grizzly, or Bruno, has been our mascot for generations. A lovable yet temper filled grizzly bear, especially when he doesn’t have his cup of joe. Like anyone would say “I’m a bear, when I don’t have coffee!” Brewno was created by a visual artist named Saanvi Arya in the year March 2nd 1990, since then he’s been with us spreading his love of coffee to all ages. One thing we know for sure, he’s a caring big eyed cuddlier with coffee and a grumpy grizzly without.

                    Abraham Houlton was born in Berlin Germany in the year 1973. As he was
                    growing up, he always loved studying the rich culture of Ethiupia also known as the
                    origin of the coffee bean. Upon his study he met his wife Charlet Jones, a savvy business
                    woman who would later help him make his love for making lattes become more 
                    than just a small bean of an idea.  It wasn’t until 1987 they opened their first coffee
                    house in their home town. They experimented, making all kinds of coffee flavors,
                    uniqueness in every cup. Now many years have gone by and The 
                    Coffee Cave’s coffee has spread worldwide.
